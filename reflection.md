iStarting a project in Django as a beginner was both exciting and challenging for me. At first, I struggled with the setup because I wasnâ€™t familiar with installing Python, Django, and setting up a virtual environment. It felt overwhelming to see so many commands and steps just to make the project run. Sometimes, I would get errors and not know what went wrong, which was frustrating. However, as I slowly followed tutorials and documentation, I began to understand how things fit together. I realized that Django is powerful because it provides many built-in tools, but it requires patience to learn. Even small achievements, like running the server or creating my first app, gave me confidence. Overall, the beginning was difficult, but I know that with more practice, the process will become easier, and Django can really help me build useful web applications.
